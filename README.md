# Armington-model-in-international-trade

Problem set instruction:
In this problem you are asked to solve comparative statics exercises using the DEK approach as explained in Lecture Notes for Armintgon model and for the EK model (Lecture 3) using the data for $X_{ij}$ in DataPS1.xls in bCourses. This dataset contains trade flows in the form $X_{ij}$ for 19 OECD countries. (This is not only trade data, because it also gives you $X_{ij}$.) Using these data, compute trade deficits as $D_n = \sum_i X_{in}-\sum_k X_{nk}$ and $Y_n$ as $Y_n = \sum_i X_{in}$. Here $\hat L_i, \hat \tau_{ni}, \hat D_n, \hat T_i$ are known, and $\hat D_n$ satisfy $\sum_n \hat D_n D_n = 0$. <br />

<ol type="a"> 
<li> Assume that the only shock is the elimination of trade deficits, $\hat D_n = 0$. What are the implications of this on relative and real wages? (Hint: in spite of trade deficits, real wages are still given by $w_j/P_j = T_j^{-1/\theta} \lambda_{jj}^{-1/\theta}$. Use the resulting "data set" with no deficits to do the following exercises. </li>
<li> Assume that there are 30/% tariffs among all countries. What happens if tariffs are removed across all countries? What happens to relative wages, real
wages and real income? Can you make sense of these results? </li>
<li> What happens if, starting from the common 30/% tariffs, the US and
Canada sign a FTA, lowering the tariffs on each other to zero? </li>
</ol>
